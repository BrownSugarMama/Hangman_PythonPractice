## TEACH YOURSELF

##  Goal
Learn a new language and also build something using what was learned in the new language.

## Technology Chosen -- Python
 Python is one of the languages that really excites me as it's the one that caught my interest and initiated my desire to learn to actually code and become a Full Stack Developer, rather than just knowing about Front End applications and code. I was first made aware of Python through joining multiple online Tech communities and reading what people were saying about Python and what it was capable of. It was also exciting because it was heralded as the best beginner language to learn for those who wanted to become Full Stack Developers, which is the goal I have now achieved. While many things I read noted that Javascript was now in the class of HTML and CSS, I was encouraged to learn JS and then Python in order to make my transition from Front End to Full Stack more comfortable and clearer. 

 Most of the online programs to learn to become a Full Stack developer catered to Javascript and other server side programs rather than Python. I tried self learning before and never really had the time to  delve in the way I wanted to. This is the perfect opportunity to do so. It also assist with another goal I want to to achieve immediately, which is becoming comfortable with working with Django. 

## The Build
    - Hangman (Game)
    The main goal of hangman is to create a sort of “guess the word” game. The user needs to be able to input letter guesses. A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use. This means there will need to be a way to grab a word to use for guessing. (This will be grabbed from a pre-made list.) Functions are also needed to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter, to check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses.

    - Why Hangman
    Building the hangman game appealed for two major reasons. 1) I'd get to build another game that was apart fo the games that were recommended for a deeper knowledge of Javascript and jQuery, so I would already be familiar with the basics of how the game should function. I would also be able to later build a JS and JQ version of the game with some coding tweaks, and, 2) I'd have the opportunity to learn and apply the following concepts, strengthening my knowledge of them:
     Random -- Variables -- Booleans -- Input and Output -- Integers -- Char -- Strings -- Length -- Print

## Biggest Hurdles
Honestly the biggest hurdle was enviornment setup. I got errors every step of the way. I kept spending so much time on installment errors that I switched to repl.it in order to get started on the project. Switching allowed me to jump into the code immediately. In teh future I think i will start my build with an online editing enviornment and then copy it to my local enviornment.
